# gRPC-WSGI

A gRPC-Web implementation based on Python's WSGI standard.

# TODO

 * Error handling
 * Compression?
 * Benchmarks?
 * StreamStream/StreamUnary RPCs?
 * Retries, caching and other client options.
 * Interop with Google's gRPC-Web implementation.
 * Quality of life integrations for Django, Flask etc.
 * application/grpc-web-text support? Do I care about IE10?
 * aiohttp / grpc-aiohttp integration?
